# GrammarCorrector

o	A writing aid that check for and suggests corrections for misspelt words, suggests alternate words to improve vocabulary and other simple related tasks such as capitalizing of certain words and removal of extra white spaces. 

o	The main concepts used to enhance the efficiency of the functionalities are Part of Speech Tags, Word Vectors, Context Free Grammar to check for correctness of the syntax.

o	The project is implemented using Python. The NLP packages used are Spacy and NLTK.


# Part of Speech Tagging : 
In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.

# Word Vectors : 
Word vectors are an immensely powerful concept and a technology that will enable significant breakthroughs in NLP applications and research. Word vectors represent a significant leap forward in advancing our ability to analyse relationships across words, sentences and documents. In doing so, they advance technology by providing machines much more information about words than has previously been possible using traditional representations of words.

# Context Free Grammar : 	
Grammar is the study of the rules governing the use of a given natural language, and, as such, is a field of linguistics. A Context-Free Grammar is a sat of rules that define the syntax of a language — what is and is not a valid sequence of “tokens”. Programming languages, for example, are context-free grammars — a compiler reads your code to make sure it conforms to specific rules and informs you of any errors.
NOTE: Better results can be obtained by explicitly creating grammars. This project checks against the grammars obtained by the PennTreebank.
